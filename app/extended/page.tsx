        <h2>Extended Job History</h2>
        <p>
          Here you&apos;ll find the past jobs I do not normally include on my
          professional resume. <br />
          As you can see below, I&apos;ve had a colorful job history working to
          get through high school and college, often working multiple jobs at
          once to make ends meet. <br />
          From this, I hope you can see some of the ambition and hard work that
          helped me get to where I am today.
