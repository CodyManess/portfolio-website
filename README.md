<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This repo is for my very own portfolio website, a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project was created to more creatively explore React and Next.js and finally check off having a portfolio website off my to-do list.

Feel free to peruse my code, offer any suggestions on how to improve it, or use it to inspire your own future creations!

If you'd like to view the site it is deployed on and see it in action, please visit [codymaness.com](https://codymaness.com).

Recently, this project has undergone enhancements focusing on:

- **Improved Data Management:** Refactored how data (like educational qualifications) is handled, promoting better separation of concerns by moving static data out of API routes.
- **Enhanced Code Quality:** Increased code readability and maintainability through measures like TSDoc comments for components, removal of console logs, and general code cleanup.
- **Best Practices & Accessibility:** Ongoing efforts to align with Next.js best practices, optimize for performance, and improve accessibility (e.g., adding ARIA attributes).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
