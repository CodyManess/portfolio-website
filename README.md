## About The Project

This repo is for my very own portfolio website, a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project was created to more creatively explore React and Next.js and finally check off having a portfolio website off my to-do list.

Feel free to peruse my code, offer any suggestions on how to improve it, or use it to inspire your own future creations!

If you'd like to view the site it is deployed on and see it in action, please visit [codymaness.com](https://codymaness.com).
